# thi.ng/shadergraph

This project provides a number of commonly used GLSL shader functions
for ClojureScript based WebGL projects and a dependency graph / resolution
mechanism for these functions. A basic shader minifier is included too.

GLSL source code can be specified as strings or read from files.

Several shader snippets have been gathered from other projects and
partially refactored.
